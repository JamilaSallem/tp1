            “The best moments in reading are when you come across something 
             – a thought, a feeling, a way of looking at things – which you 
             had thought special and particular to you.<br> Now here it is,
             set down by someone else, a person you have never met,
             someone even who is long dead. <br>
             And it is as if a hand has come out and taken yours.”<br>
            ― Alan Bennett</h5>
